Hello, my name is Luke.

This blog will be a place for me to share my rambling thoughts and technical
knowledge.

I have been tinkering with electronics and computers since I was 8 years old,
causing my parents untold grief by dismantling things _(without permission)_
to figure out how they work

My experiences within the computing world have been both exciting and varied,
with an undertone of Unix-like operating systems, open-source software and
"the web".

As I continue to explore and expand my knowledge, blogging about it on this
website, I extend an invitation for you to provide feedback and criticism.
