    <h2>Full stack developer</h2>

    <p>
      Iâ€™ve worked at all levels of an application including the end user experience,
      backend business logic, sysadmin and operations, designing interfaces and
      protocols between components and integration with external systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am experienced with the whole development lifecycle including
      initial concept and requirements gathering, research and prototyping,
      guiding the overall development effort undertaken by a team
      and commissioning solutions within customer premises on the opposite side of
      the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      My wide spectrum of experience allows me to take the initiative in finding
      solutions to your problems and delivering value.

    <h2>Adaptable</h2>
    <p>
      I have worked within a multitude of industrial sectors such as
      automotive, tourism and trade. I thrive on solving problems and have the
      ability to adapt my skills to the problem at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't claim to always have the answer, I understand my own limitations
      and will seek assistance and guidance from colleagues and friends
      in these situations to help you find a relevant solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always eager to learn how things work and expand my knowledge,
      especially through collaboration and discussion.
